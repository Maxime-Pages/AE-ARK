#Introduction
This is a document reporting the status and advancement of my moonshot project name AE-ARK, which stands for Actually Easy Augmented Reality Kit , which is a scripting language aimed at AR (augmented reality). This project is aimed at providing an easier and more streamlined way to create AR applications and experiences.

#Advancement Report
One of the first steps I took was to research and learn about existing alternatives in the market, such as Unity, Vuforia, and ARKit. I analyzed their strengths and weaknesses to understand what sets AE-ARK apart and what unique features it could offer. This research helped me identify the gap in the market that AE-ARK could fill, and I started outlining the core features of the language.

After creating a rough prototype of the language, I began looking for industry contacts to discuss the project with. This included reaching out to developers and other experts in the AR field to get their feedback on the project and gather insights on what features they would like to see in a scripting language for AR. I also sought out potential partners and investors who might be interested in the project.

Overall, my focus has been on understanding the existing market and identifying gaps, while also seeking out contacts in the industry to help refine and develop the project further. I am excited to continue working on AE-ARK and bring this new tool to the world of augmented reality development.
